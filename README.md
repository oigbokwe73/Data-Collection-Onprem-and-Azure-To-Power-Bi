| **Azure Storage Blob Container**| This resource stores log files generated by various applications in the integration platform. The system extracts and counts the number of log files created daily. | - Number of logs created<br>- Log size<br>- File creation timestamp                                                                | The platform processes logs from different applications and extracts daily logs from the Blob Container for auditing.      |
| **Azure Storage Queue**        | Captures the number of messages received by the queue, the number of successfully processed messages, and the count of messages sent to the Dead Letter Queue.      | - Number of messages received<br>- Number of messages delivered<br>- Number of messages in Dead Letter Queue<br>- Queue latency    | The platform monitors message flow, processing success rates, and error messages that are redirected to the Dead Letter Queue. |
| **Azure Dead Letter Queue**    | This is used to store messages that could not be processed successfully after multiple retries, helping in troubleshooting and error handling.                      | - Number of messages moved to the Dead Letter Queue<br>- Error reason for Dead Letter messages<br>- Timestamps of failed messages | Ensures that all unprocessable messages are captured for further analysis and troubleshooting via the Dead Letter Queue.    |

### Mermaid Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram shows the flow from **log creation** in the **Azure Blob Container** to processing messages in the **Azure Storage Queue**, including the handling of messages in the **Dead Letter Queue**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Blob as Azure Blob Container
    participant Queue as Azure Storage Queue
    participant DLQ as Dead Letter Queue
    participant SIPlatform as System Integration Platform
    participant Monitoring as Monitoring Service

    App->>Blob: Upload log files
    Blob-->>SIPlatform: Extract number of logs created
    SIPlatform->>Monitoring: Send log metrics (log count, size, timestamps)

    App->>Queue: Send message to Queue
    Queue-->>SIPlatform: Extract message details (received vs delivered)
    SIPlatform->>Monitoring: Send queue metrics (messages received, delivered)

    Queue->>DLQ: Send failed messages to Dead Letter Queue
    DLQ-->>SIPlatform: Capture Dead Letter details
    SIPlatform->>Monitoring: Send Dead Letter Queue metrics (message count, errors)
```

### Sequence Flow Explanation:

1. **Log File Upload**: 
   - The application uploads log files to the **Azure Blob Container**. 
   - The **System Integration Platform (SIPlatform)** extracts details like the number of logs created, their size, and timestamps from the Blob storage.

2. **Message Flow to Azure Queue**:
   - The application sends messages to the **Azure Storage Queue**. 
   - The **SIPlatform** monitors the message flow, capturing details about the number of messages received and delivered.

3. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
   - Messages that cannot be processed successfully after multiple retries are sent to the **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. 
   - The **SIPlatform** extracts error messages, failure reasons, and timestamps from the DLQ.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - The **Monitoring Service** is updated with metrics from both the **Blob Container** and **Storage Queue**, including the count of logs created, messages processed, and Dead Letter Queue details.

This flow allows efficient monitoring and error handling of logs and messages in your **System Integration Platform** connected to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Storage Queue. Let me know if you'd like further details or customizations!








I have provided the detailed table describing the use case where Power BI is connected to Azure resources, including Azure Function App, Blob Storage, Storage Queue, Azure Monitor, and Azure SQL. 

Now, let's create the **Mermaid Sequence Diagram** that illustrates the flow of data from the Azure Function App to Power BI:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FunctionApp1 as Azure Function App (Blob Logs)
    participant Blob as Azure Storage Blob Container
    participant FunctionApp2 as Azure Function App (Queue Messages)
    participant Queue as Azure Storage Queue
    participant Monitor as Azure Monitor
    participant SQL as Azure SQL Database
    participant PBI as Power BI
    
    FunctionApp1->>Blob: Extract number of logs created
    Blob-->>FunctionApp1: Return logs count
    FunctionApp1->>Monitor: Log extracted information
    
    FunctionApp2->>Queue: Capture messages received
    Queue-->>FunctionApp2: Return received messages
    FunctionApp2->>Monitor: Log messages delivered to destination
    FunctionApp2->>Monitor: Log number of messages sent to Dead Letter Queue
    
    PBI->>SQL: Query logs and message data
    SQL-->>PBI: Return logs and message statistics
    PBI->>PBI: Visualize reports and dashboards
```

### Explanation of the Flow:
1. **Azure Function App (Blob Logs)**: Extracts the number of logs created in the Blob Storage and logs this information to Azure Monitor.
2. **Azure Function App (Queue Messages)**: Captures messages from the Storage Queue and logs both successful deliveries and messages sent to the Dead Letter Queue in Azure Monitor.
3. **Power BI**: Queries Azure SQL to gather data on logs, messages received, and messages sent to the Dead Letter Queue. This data is visualized as reports and dashboards for monitoring.

This setup ensures robust monitoring and real-time reporting on log creation and message delivery. Let me know if you need further details!

### Explanation of Each Resource:

- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores structured data that will be used by Power BI to generate reports. This could include transactional data, processed logs, or performance metrics stored in tables.

```

### Flow Explanation:

1. **MoveIT on Azure VM**: 
   - The MoveIT application, hosted on an Azure Virtual Machine, generates logs from its operations (such as file transfers, errors, and user activity).
   - These logs are captured and sent to **Azure Blob Storage** for central storage.

2. **Azure Blob Storage**:
   - The logs are stored in an **Azure Blob Container**, serving as the primary data repository for the logs.
   - **Azure Monitor** monitors Blob Storage for activity, including when logs are uploaded, and tracks the overall health of the storage.

3. **Azure Function App** (Optional):
   - If processing or transforming of the log data is needed before it can be visualized, an **Azure Function App** can be triggered by the new log entries in Blob Storage.
   - The function app processes the logs and stores the structured data in **Azure SQL Database** (if needed).

4. **Azure SQL Database** (Optional):
   - Once logs are processed and transformed, the structured data is stored in **Azure SQL Database** for easy querying and visualization.

5. **Power BI**:
   - **Power BI** connects to either **Azure Blob Storage** (for raw logs) or **Azure SQL Database** (for structured data) to generate reports and visual dashboards.
   - The reports provide real-time insights into MoveIT performance, including the number of log entries, messages received, and errors.

6. **Azure Monitor**:
   - **Azure Monitor** tracks the health and performance of the VM running MoveIT, the Blob Storage holding the logs, the Function App processing the data, and any other related resources.
   - Alerts and diagnostics can be set up to notify administrators of issues in the log processing or VM performance.

     - A scheduled task or a logging service on the Azure VM is configured to automatically transfer the logs to an **Azure Blob Storage** container. This could be done using an automation script, MoveITâ€™s built-in logging features, or custom code.
     - Logs are sent at regular intervals or after specific actions (e.g., every hour, after every file transfer).

#### 2. **Azure Blob Storage: Centralized Log Storage**
   - **Details**: The transferred logs from MoveIT are stored in **Azure Blob Storage**. Blob storage is a scalable, secure solution for storing large volumes of unstructured data, such as logs.
   - **Actions**:
     - Logs are uploaded to a designated container within the Blob Storage account (e.g., `moveit-logs`).
     - Azure Blob Storage securely holds the raw log files, and access to the logs is controlled via **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Access Keys**.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Logs are stored in a hierarchical manner (e.g., by date or event type) for easier access and management.
     - Blob lifecycle policies can be applied to automatically archive or delete old logs, optimizing storage costs.
   - **Example Logs**:
     - `moveit-logs/2024-01-01/system.log`
     - `moveit-logs/2024-01-02/transfer.log`

#### 3. **Azure Monitor: Monitoring and Analyzing Logs**
   - **Details**: **Azure Monitor** is configured to observe the activity of both the Azure VM running MoveIT and the Azure Blob Storage where the logs are stored.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Azure Monitor** tracks the health of the **Azure VM**, capturing metrics like **CPU usage**, **memory consumption**, and **network activity**. Alerts can be configured for resource threshold breaches (e.g., if CPU usage goes above 80%).
     - **Log Diagnostics**: Azure Monitor is set up to capture **Blob Storage diagnostic logs**, including file upload/download activity, failures, and storage utilization. 
     - **Log Analytics**: These logs are aggregated in **Azure Log Analytics**, where you can run **Kusto queries** to analyze the performance and behavior of MoveIT, identify issues, and track patterns.
     - Alerts can be set up for:
       - Failure in file transfers.
       - Excessive log generation (which could indicate system issues).
       - Unusual activity such as spikes in error logs or failed login attempts.
   - **Azure Monitor Dashboard**:
     - A custom dashboard can be created in Azure Monitor to visualize performance metrics and log data in real-time.
     - Metrics include:
       - Number of logs generated over time.
       - Success and failure rates of file transfers.
       - System performance on the VM.

#### 4. **Azure Function App: Processing Logs (Optional)**
   - **Details**: An **Azure Function App** can be triggered to process logs when new log files are uploaded to the Blob Storage. This step is optional, but beneficial if the logs need to be cleaned, transformed, or aggregated before being pushed to a database or directly visualized in Power BI.
   - **Actions**:
     - The **Blob Trigger** in the Function App detects when new log files are written to Blob Storage and triggers the execution of the function.
     - **Log Parsing**: The function reads the raw logs and extracts key data points, such as:
       - **Number of Log Entries**.
       - **Messages Received** (successful file transfers).
       - **Messages Delivered** (successful deliveries to the destination).
       - **Messages Sent to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** (failed messages).
     - After processing, the transformed data can be:
       - **Stored in Azure SQL Database**: For more structured querying and reporting.
       - **Pushed to an Event Hub** for real-time event processing.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Azure Functions provide a scalable, serverless way to process logs without the need to manage infrastructure.
     - Functions can be used to apply business logic, such as filtering out irrelevant logs or generating summary reports.
   
#### 5. **Azure SQL Database (Optional): Storing Structured Log Data**
   - **Details**: If structured storage is required for efficient querying and reporting, an **Azure SQL Database** can be used to store parsed and processed log data.
   - **Actions**:
     - The processed logs from the **Azure Function App** are written into the Azure SQL Database in a structured format (e.g., tables).
     - **Schema Example**:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE LogSummary (
           Id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
           LogEntries INT,
           MessagesReceived INT,
           MessagesDelivered INT,
           MessagesDLQ INT,
           Timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
       );
       ```
     - This allows **Power BI** to efficiently query the SQL Database to generate reports on the systemâ€™s performance and log activity.
     - **Query Examples**:
       - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LogSummary WHERE MessagesDLQ > 0;` (Total messages sent to DLQ).
       - `SELECT MessagesReceived, MessagesDelivered FROM LogSummary ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;` (Recent logs showing system performance).

#### 6. **Power BI: Visualizing the Logs**
   - **Details**: **Power BI** is used to generate visual reports and dashboards that offer insights into the MoveIT logs and overall system performance. Power BI can directly query **Azure SQL Database** (if structured data is stored) or connect to **Azure Blob Storage** for raw data visualization.
   - **Actions**:
     - Power BI connects to **Azure SQL Database** using the **Azure SQL Database connector** or directly to Blob Storage if using **Power BI Dataflows** to transform raw data.
     - Reports and dashboards are created to visualize key metrics:
       - **Number of Log Entries**: A bar chart showing the number of log entries over time.
       - **Messages Received**: A line graph showing the number of successful file transfers.
       - **Messages Delivered**: A pie chart displaying the ratio of messages delivered vs. messages failed.
       - **Messages Sent to DLQ**: A table summarizing the failures over time.
     - **Refresh Schedules**: Data refresh schedules are configured to update Power BI reports automatically based on new logs.
   - **Example Power BI Dashboard**:
     - **Top Panel**: Real-time monitoring of the number of log entries and messages received.
     - **Middle Panel**: Success rate of file transfers and deliveries.
     - **Bottom Panel**: Error reports, showing messages sent to the DLQ, along with error details.

#### 7. **Azure Monitor: Monitoring End-to-End System Performance**
   - **Details**: **Azure Monitor** continuously monitors all the components of the system, including:
     - **Azure VM**: Tracking MoveIT application performance, network activity, and resource consumption.
     - **Azure Blob Storage**: Monitoring log uploads, read/write access, and storage capacity.
     - **Azure Function App**: Tracking function execution times, errors, and performance metrics.
     - **Azure SQL Database**: Monitoring query performance, data integrity, and connection issues.
   - **Actions**:
     - Alerts can be set up in Azure Monitor to notify administrators of:
       - High CPU or memory usage on the Azure VM.
       - File transfer failures in MoveIT.
       - Latency in the processing of logs.
       - Query performance issues in Azure SQL Database.
     - **Dashboards**: Custom Azure Monitor dashboards can be created to provide a holistic view of the entire system, showing:
       - System health.
       - Transfer success rates.
       - Error rates (DLQ entries).
       - Resource utilization of the Azure VM and other components.
