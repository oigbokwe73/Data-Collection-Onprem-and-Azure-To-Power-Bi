| **Azure Storage Blob Container**| This resource stores log files generated by various applications in the integration platform. The system extracts and counts the number of log files created daily. | - Number of logs created<br>- Log size<br>- File creation timestamp                                                                | The platform processes logs from different applications and extracts daily logs from the Blob Container for auditing.      |
| **Azure Storage Queue**        | Captures the number of messages received by the queue, the number of successfully processed messages, and the count of messages sent to the Dead Letter Queue.      | - Number of messages received<br>- Number of messages delivered<br>- Number of messages in Dead Letter Queue<br>- Queue latency    | The platform monitors message flow, processing success rates, and error messages that are redirected to the Dead Letter Queue. |
| **Azure Dead Letter Queue**    | This is used to store messages that could not be processed successfully after multiple retries, helping in troubleshooting and error handling.                      | - Number of messages moved to the Dead Letter Queue<br>- Error reason for Dead Letter messages<br>- Timestamps of failed messages | Ensures that all unprocessable messages are captured for further analysis and troubleshooting via the Dead Letter Queue.    |

### Mermaid Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram shows the flow from **log creation** in the **Azure Blob Container** to processing messages in the **Azure Storage Queue**, including the handling of messages in the **Dead Letter Queue**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Blob as Azure Blob Container
    participant Queue as Azure Storage Queue
    participant DLQ as Dead Letter Queue
    participant SIPlatform as System Integration Platform
    participant Monitoring as Monitoring Service

    App->>Blob: Upload log files
    Blob-->>SIPlatform: Extract number of logs created
    SIPlatform->>Monitoring: Send log metrics (log count, size, timestamps)

    App->>Queue: Send message to Queue
    Queue-->>SIPlatform: Extract message details (received vs delivered)
    SIPlatform->>Monitoring: Send queue metrics (messages received, delivered)

    Queue->>DLQ: Send failed messages to Dead Letter Queue
    DLQ-->>SIPlatform: Capture Dead Letter details
    SIPlatform->>Monitoring: Send Dead Letter Queue metrics (message count, errors)
```

### Sequence Flow Explanation:

1. **Log File Upload**: 
   - The application uploads log files to the **Azure Blob Container**. 
   - The **System Integration Platform (SIPlatform)** extracts details like the number of logs created, their size, and timestamps from the Blob storage.

2. **Message Flow to Azure Queue**:
   - The application sends messages to the **Azure Storage Queue**. 
   - The **SIPlatform** monitors the message flow, capturing details about the number of messages received and delivered.

3. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
   - Messages that cannot be processed successfully after multiple retries are sent to the **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. 
   - The **SIPlatform** extracts error messages, failure reasons, and timestamps from the DLQ.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - The **Monitoring Service** is updated with metrics from both the **Blob Container** and **Storage Queue**, including the count of logs created, messages processed, and Dead Letter Queue details.

This flow allows efficient monitoring and error handling of logs and messages in your **System Integration Platform** connected to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Storage Queue. Let me know if you'd like further details or customizations!








I have provided the detailed table describing the use case where Power BI is connected to Azure resources, including Azure Function App, Blob Storage, Storage Queue, Azure Monitor, and Azure SQL. 

Now, let's create the **Mermaid Sequence Diagram** that illustrates the flow of data from the Azure Function App to Power BI:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FunctionApp1 as Azure Function App (Blob Logs)
    participant Blob as Azure Storage Blob Container
    participant FunctionApp2 as Azure Function App (Queue Messages)
    participant Queue as Azure Storage Queue
    participant Monitor as Azure Monitor
    participant SQL as Azure SQL Database
    participant PBI as Power BI
    
    FunctionApp1->>Blob: Extract number of logs created
    Blob-->>FunctionApp1: Return logs count
    FunctionApp1->>Monitor: Log extracted information
    
    FunctionApp2->>Queue: Capture messages received
    Queue-->>FunctionApp2: Return received messages
    FunctionApp2->>Monitor: Log messages delivered to destination
    FunctionApp2->>Monitor: Log number of messages sent to Dead Letter Queue
    
    PBI->>SQL: Query logs and message data
    SQL-->>PBI: Return logs and message statistics
    PBI->>PBI: Visualize reports and dashboards
```

### Explanation of the Flow:
1. **Azure Function App (Blob Logs)**: Extracts the number of logs created in the Blob Storage and logs this information to Azure Monitor.
2. **Azure Function App (Queue Messages)**: Captures messages from the Storage Queue and logs both successful deliveries and messages sent to the Dead Letter Queue in Azure Monitor.
3. **Power BI**: Queries Azure SQL to gather data on logs, messages received, and messages sent to the Dead Letter Queue. This data is visualized as reports and dashboards for monitoring.

This setup ensures robust monitoring and real-time reporting on log creation and message delivery. Let me know if you need further details!
